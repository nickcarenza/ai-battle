AI Programming Battle
=====================
Two or more programmers develop competing programs with limited resources.

Gameplay
--------
 - As the game progresses, the programmers can gain access to higher character limits, more language contructs and more system resources.
 - Programmers can earn advantages by completing challenges or discovering hidden caches in memory.

Challenges
----------
 - Using a specific subset of the available language constructs
 - Using a particularly low character count
 - Making no modifications to code from previous stages
 - Using a specific language

Scenarios
---------
 - Resource Hog: Programmers compete to consume 100% of system resources
 - Resource Dash: Programmers race to consume 50% of system resources
 - RoboBoxing: Duck, juke, hook and jab. Your AI can respond to events like `incomingLeftJab`  and respond with punches like `jukeRight()`, but beware the `fakeLeftJeb()` and `rightUppoercut()` combo!.
